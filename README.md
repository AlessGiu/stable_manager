🐎 Stable Manager – Odoo Module
Stable Manager is an Odoo module developed as part of my Python/Odoo developer training.
It aims to help horse stable managers efficiently handle their day-to-day operations, such as managing horses, rations, employees, and scheduling tasks using Kanban and Gantt views.

👨‍💻 Developer Notes
This module was started during the third month of my 6-month Python/Odoo training.
It is both an educational and real-world project — designed to help me practice:

Python fundamentals (OOP, ORM, inheritance)

XML views and widgets

Scheduled actions

Kanban views

Model relationships (One2many, Many2one)

Custom wizards and smart buttons

The module is still a work in progress: many features remain to be implemented, but the structure is already taking shape.

I'm currently in my third month of training to become an Odoo developer, with a focus on backend logic and intuitive interface design.
This project is especially meaningful to me: my partner runs a horse stable, and together we decided to digitize her stable management using Odoo.
It’s both a personal and professional challenge, and a great opportunity to apply what I’m learning in a real-life context.
